# Hyflip Mod
A mod designed to bring flips right to your Minecraft client. Uses the powerful hyflip backend server, and can be paired
with the website for extra efficiency.

Note: I don't know Kotlin that well </3

# TODO:
- [] Work on a config UI first. The getting-data-from-backend stuff shouldn't be too hard, but idk how any Minecraft-specific
java/kotlin code works so that is a priority.
