# Hyflip Mod
A mod designed to bring flips right to your Minecraft client. Uses the powerful hyflip backend server, and can be paired
with the website for extra efficiency.

Note: I don't know Kotlin that well </3

# TODO:
- [x] Work on a config UI first. The getting-data-from-backend stuff shouldn't be too hard, but idk how any Minecraft-specific
java/kotlin code works so that is a priority.
- [] Use the user config received from the backend into config.json. Both are in JSON but ensure their format is similar OR add a translation layer.
- [] If the user makes a change in the default config, send it over to the server.
